# Lab 0 - Sign In to AWS

In this lab, you will sign in to your AWS account and verify access to Amazon Bedrock services.

**Important:** During the sign-up process, be sure to note your AWS Account ID and Region as they will be needed throughout the labs.

## Option A: Workshop Event (OneBlink)

If you are attending an instructor-led workshop, you will receive credentials through OneBlink:

1. At the end of the first presentation, you will receive an event code
2. Visit [https://neo4jsandbox.oneblink.ai/gate](https://neo4jsandbox.oneblink.ai/gate)
3. Enter the email you used to register along with the 7-digit event code
4. Check the box to agree to the Terms and Conditions, then click **Register**

Check your mailbox to get the OneBlink validation code, then copy the code.

![Validation Email](images/validation_email.png)

Enter your email, the event code from the information sheet, and the validation code from your email, then click **Access Sandbox**.

Once validated, you will receive your AWS credentials. **Save this information** - you will need it for all subsequent labs. These accounts will be terminated at the end of the workshop.

## Option B: Using Your Own AWS Account

If you are using your own AWS account:

1. Ensure you have an IAM user with appropriate permissions for:
   - Amazon Bedrock (model access and agent creation)
   - CloudFormation (for CDK deployment)
2. Create access keys for programmatic access if needed for Labs 4-7

## Sign into AWS Console

1. Open the AWS Console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)

2. Enter your Account ID (or account alias) and click **Next**

3. Enter your IAM username and password, then click **Sign in**

4. You are now signed in to the AWS Console

## Select the Correct Region

Amazon Bedrock is available in select regions. For this workshop, we recommend **US East (N. Virginia) - us-east-1** for the widest model availability.

1. Look at the region selector in the top-right corner of the console
2. Click on it and select **US East (N. Virginia)**

## Verify Bedrock Access

1. In the AWS Console search bar, type **Bedrock** and select **Amazon Bedrock**
2. In the left sidebar under **Test**, click **Playground**
3. Click **Select model**, choose **Anthropic** as the provider, then select **Claude Sonnet 4.6** and click **Apply**
4. Enter the following test prompt and run it:

   > In 2-3 sentences, explain what GraphRAG is and why a knowledge graph like Neo4j can improve retrieval-augmented generation compared to plain vector search.

5. If you get a response, your Bedrock access is working and you are ready for the labs.

**Note:** Access to all Amazon Bedrock foundation models is enabled by default in commercial AWS regions, so there is no longer a separate model access request step. The first time you invoke an Anthropic model in a brand-new account, you may be prompted to complete a one-time use case form, after which access is granted immediately.

## Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" when accessing Bedrock
- Verify your IAM user has the `AmazonBedrockFullAccess` policy attached
- Check you are in a supported region (us-east-1 recommended)

### Model returns "Access Denied" on first invoke
- Foundation model access is enabled by default, but the account needs AWS Marketplace permissions for the automatic subscription to complete
- For a brand-new account, complete the one-time Anthropic use case form when prompted, then retry
- Confirm the account has a valid payment method configured

### Cannot find Bedrock in services
- Ensure you are in a region that supports Bedrock
- Try switching to us-east-1 (N. Virginia)
