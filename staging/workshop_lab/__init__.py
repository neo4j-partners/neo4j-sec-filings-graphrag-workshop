"""Utility classes the Vocareum lab notebook installs from GitHub.

The notebook cannot rely on files shipped beside it. Vocareum's documentation
says everything in `/voc/startercode` is copied into each student's `/voc/work`
and that Jupyter puts the notebook's directory on `sys.path`, so a sibling
module should import. Measured 2026-08-06 in a live session: it does not. What
does work, measured the same day, is fetching Python over HTTPS from a public
GitHub repository, so this package is installed rather than shipped:

    %pip install "https://github.com/neo4j-partners/neo4j-sec-filings-graphrag-workshop/archive/refs/tags/v0.13.4.zip#subdirectory=staging"

**This directory is the source of truth, and it is not the copy the notebook
installs.** `aws-vocareum` is private, and a private repository answers
`raw.githubusercontent.com` and the archive endpoint with 404 rather than 403,
so the notebook cannot install from here. `scripts/sync_workshop_lab.py`
publishes this package into the public workshop repository's `staging/`
directory, and `tests/test_workshop_lab_drift.py` fails when the two disagree.
Edit here, never there.

The version below is what the notebook prints in step 0. Bump it whenever the
published copy changes, so a student's output names the code they actually ran
rather than the code that was current when the notebook was written.
